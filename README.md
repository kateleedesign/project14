In my program, I wanted give an environmental message regarding Emperor penguins in Antartica. As the viewer click and follow the baby penguin, the background blurs more and more causing the baby penguin to be further away from its family. Meanwhile the messages tell a story that starts by saying that these penguins donâ€™t have land predators. However the penguins are still endangered ultimately due to the melting ice which is caused by humans (viewer). By allowing the viewer to have physical control that affects the amount of blur applied, the viewer becomes aware of the impact they hold on both the virtual penguin and real penguins that are in Antartica currently. The black wave that seeps into the frame represents this gloomy impact on the baby penguin and the rising water level.
